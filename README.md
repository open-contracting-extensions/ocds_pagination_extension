# Pagination

Adds a links object to packages, to support pagination.

## Links

The top-level `links` object in release packages and record packages has three fields:

* `next`: A URL to the next sequential package
* `prev`: A URL to the previous sequential package

To construct the `next` and/or `prev` URLs, it is encouraged to use query string parameters like:

* `since=TIMESTAMP`, to return a page of results that are modified after the `since` timestamp, in chronological order
* `offset=NUMBER`, to return a page of results that are positioned after the `offset` number, in sequential order (for example, if the results are retrieved from a [SQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-limit.html))

It is discouraged to use `page=NUMBER` with results ordered in reverse chronology, because:

* A given page won't return the same results over time. `page=1` will return different results today, next week, and next year.
* Users can receive duplicate results while paginating. For example, if a new release is published to page 1 while users are paginating, then the result at the bottom of each page will be moved to the top of the following page.
* It is harder for users to synchronize with the API. With `since` or `offset`, users can retrieve new results by submitting the timestamp or offset of their last request. With `page`, users need to determine which results are new or old.

### Example

A publisher has a large number of releases. Instead of gathering them into one release package, it segments them into multiple release packages, via an API with pagination. The `links.next` field provides the link to the next page.
